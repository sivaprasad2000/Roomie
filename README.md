# Roomie

An app that helps a user find a partner to share accomodation with while leasing/sub - leasing a property.
The app enables a user to go through a list of possible roomies implicitly filtered by location, with other filters such as gender and age that can be applied as the user wants to.
Users may also use the app to advertise their intent to lease/sub - lease their property to find clients.
